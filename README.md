# TabsCopierExtension

## Description
Simple extension for Firefox browser that allows user to copy links to each open tab. The link will be copied to clipboard in list format, where each link has its own line.
I find myself sometimes needing to copy link from multiple tabs to save or send somewhere and its starting to get annoying, so I decided to made this.

## How to install
